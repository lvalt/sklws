In 2018, the government of the Russian Federation and CERN are planning to sign a new agreement which will confirm Russia's participation in the second phase of construction of the Large Hadron Collider and all experiments on that accelerator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has performed a large proof-of-concept utilizing more than 1000 virtual machines on the Open Telekom Cloud, performing workloads from the different experiments on the Large Hadron Collider. The results were positive throughout, evidenced by the fact that the Open Telekom Cloud was selected to provide services to support the Helix Nebula Science Cloud, enabling Europe's biggest research centres, CERN, EMBL, IFAE and others to make use of public cloud service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "57  Body   Speedy neutrinos observed again Researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland observed neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, results similar to those they observed in September. A stricter tolerance for errors was enforced for this second test as a result of skepticism over the results in the team's initial experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "59  The God Particle has been around since the dawn of time, and the search for proof of its existence is critical to our understanding of the nature, expansion, and potential fate of the universe. In order to unravel these mysteries, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) invested $9 billion to construct the world's largest experimental facility-the Large Hadron Collider. In 2012, after decades of hard work by nearly 10,000 scientists, CERN at last announced the successful discovery of the Higgs boson, popularly known as the God Particle.
